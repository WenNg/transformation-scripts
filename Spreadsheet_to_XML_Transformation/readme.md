# Using the Spreadsheet to XML Transformation #
Working with a new workflow or technology can be daunting, but individuals in the museum, library, and archives community are known for supporting each other while we all learn new skills. If you have any questions about any part of this mini-guide, please feel free to contact Elizabeth James, Digital Archivist at West Virginia University Libraries, at elizabeth.james1@mail.wvu.edu.

## 1. Download the folder containing the necessary files. ##
First, [download the folder containing the spreadsheet and transformation file using this link.](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/dplava/transformation-scripts/tree/main/Spreadsheet_to_XML_Transformation/DPLAVA_Transformation)

## 2. Unzip the folder. ##
Go to the "Downloads" folder on your computer. Click on the DPLAVA_Transformation.zip folder, go to the "Compressed Folder Tools" tab (circled below with 1 next to it), and click "Extract All" (circled with 2 next to it).

## 3. Go to your Google Drive home page and upload the folder. ##
Go to your [Google Drive home page](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive). This step requires a Gmail account and every Gmail account has access to Google Drive.

Add the folder by clicking "New" (circled below with a 1 next to it) and subsequently clicking "Add Folder".

Navigate to the folder you uncompressed. Be sure to select the "DPLAVA_Transformation" folder *inside* the uncompressed "DPLAVA_Transformation" folder. It's a little confusing, but you just want to upload the folder directly containing files rather than the folder containing a folder containing the files. You can see in the file path below that we are grabbing the "DPLAVA_Transformation" folder *inside* the uncompressed "DPLAVA_Transformation" folder.

## 4. Go to the folder in your Google Drive to verify everything looks as it should. ##
Your "DPLAVA_Transformation" folder should be one of the first things you can see when you open your [Google Drive home page](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive). See the example circled below.

When you click and open the folder, you should see a folder called "Output_XML" and two files. If you see another "DPLAVA_Transformation" folder, you need to move that inner folder to the home Google Drive area so that it is the first thing you see when you open your [Google Drive home page](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive).

## 5. Now: time to input metadata! ##
In the "DPLAVA_Transformation" folder is the "DPLA_Ingest_Spreadsheet.xslx" file, where you will put your metadata, and the "DPLAVA CSV to XML Transformation Script" file. There are instructions inside the spreadsheet on how to use it to create metadata.

## 6. Transform the metadata. ##
Once you are finished with the spreadsheet file, you can then go to the "DPLAVA CSV to XML Transformation Script" file and follow the instructions to transform the content you put in your spreadsheet. All newly created files will be output to the "Output_XML" folder. These files can then be uploaded to your institution's repository on the DPLAVA github, where you can see whether there are any error messages or issues with the data that you input. 

# Congrats! You did it! #
