# Using the Spreadsheet to XML Transformation #
## 1. Download the folder containing the necessary files. ##
First, [download the folder containing the spreadsheet and transformation file using this link.](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/dplava/transformation-scripts/tree/main/Spreadsheet_to_XML_Transformation/DPLAVA_Transformation)
## 2. Unzip the folder. ##
Go to the "Downloads" folder on your computer. Click on the DPLAVA_Transformation.zip folder, go to the "Compressed Folder Tools" tab (circled below with 1 next to it), and click "Extract All" (circled with 2 next to it).

## 3. Go to your Google Drive home page and upload the folder. ##

Navigate to the folder you uncompressed. Be sure to select the "DPLAVA_Transformation" folder *inside* the uncompressed "DPLAVA_Transformation" folder. It's a little confusing, but you just want to upload the folder directly containing files rather than the folder containing a folder containing the files.
